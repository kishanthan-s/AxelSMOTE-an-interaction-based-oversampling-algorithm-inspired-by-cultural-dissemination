AxelSMOTE is a novel oversampling technique inspired by Axelrod’s cultural dissemination model.
The proposed approach implements four key innovations:
(1) trait-based feature grouping to preserve correlations; 
(2) a similarity-based probabilistic exchange mechanism for meaningful interactions; 
(3) Beta distribution blending for realistic interpolation; 
(4) controlled diversity injection to avoid overfitting
AxelSMOTE overcomes key limitations of traditional oversamplers.
